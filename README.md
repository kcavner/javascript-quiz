## Description
- This is a javascript quiz i have created with javascript html and css. It starts the quiz with a start button and presents questions to be clicked on and gives the next question, and if they got the question right.



## Details
- the javascript quiz will tally correct answers and at the end of the quiz shows how many out of the total you got right. not only that but it takes the time you ended with and saves that to local storage so you can save your best score.

## What it solves
- this solves a need for a javascript quiz, not only is it good to test yourself on knowledge but the creation of the quiz itself was a great exercise in coding as well.

## What i learned
- i learned how to dynamically create elements that are created under a set parent element. I also learned how to grab and work with elements and give them functionality with adding and removing attributes giving different effects like hiding visibility.
